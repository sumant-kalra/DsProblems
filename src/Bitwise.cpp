// Time Complexity - O(n), where n is the count of bits in the number
// Keeping the original number unchanged, and creating a new bitmask for each digit of the number

// Advantages -
// [1] Avoids the dependency on the number of bits of the number
// [2] Bitshift left operator is safer than the bitshift right as in the case of signed numbers

// Approach 2 - O(k), k = count of 1s in the bit representation of the number
// By isolating on the bits which are set to 1 and keeping a count of them.
// We can replace the lowest bit that is 1 with 0 in an integer valued number by using two methods:
//
// x = Input number
// Method A
// y = x & ~(x-1) isolates the lowest bit that is 1
// x = y ^ x updates x to a new value with the lowest 1 eliminated
// Iterate this process until all the 1 are eliminated from x, keeping a count of 1s
//
// Method B
// x = x & (x-1) elimates the lowest bit that is 1 from the input
// Iterate this process until all the 1 are eliminated from x, keeping a count of 1s
//
// Advantage
// [1] Time complexity of the operation becomes O(k), k = count of 1s in the bit representation of the number
